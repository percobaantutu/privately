Privately is a feature-rich, fullstack web application designed to connect students with professional teachers for one-on-one online tutoring sessions. The platform provides a seamless experience for three distinct user roles: students seeking knowledge, teachers sharing their expertise, and administrators managing the platform's integrity and operations.

This project is built with a modern technology stack and demonstrates a complete end-to-end development cycle, from user authentication and real-time communication to payment processing and administrative oversight.
